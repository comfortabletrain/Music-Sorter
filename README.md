# Music-Sorter
A basic program to list lots of classical music.

A program that will hopefully be eventually used and linked up with a data-base to be able to list all the 
music written in a certain time or in a certain style or with other modifiers 

If you want to help, you can! I would love some tutorials on basic java, because I'm still learning :)

Thanks to Carrie Krueger for teaching me!
